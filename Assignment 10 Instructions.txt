For the final assignment of this course, implement a K-means based segmentation algorithm to 
work on grayscale images.

1) Show the results on the image of crop circles (convert to grayscale first) for K = 2,3,4 clusters.

2) Next Show the results on your mugshot for K = 2,3,4 clusters.

 

3) And finally, show the result one or two brain images from this file: BrainImagesGrayscale.rar
