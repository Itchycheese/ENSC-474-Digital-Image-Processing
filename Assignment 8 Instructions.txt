Part 2: Take your mugshot image. Now take your mugshot image with your head 
rotated slightly and smiling/winking. Now register the rotated image with 
the smile/wink to the original mugshot using landmarks that you have placed 
manually on the two images, and show the difference image. Where possible, 
use your own functions and where needed, feel free to use any MATLAB 
functions to solve the problem. Discuss the effect of the angle of 
rotation on the registration ie does the quality of registration depend on 
how much the rotation is? (80 points)
