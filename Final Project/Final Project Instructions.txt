Imaging and calcuating density maps of rods and cones in a living human retina non-invasively

ENSC Professor Sarunic designs state-of-art laser Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scanning systems 
that use laser light to generate 3D images of the retina. These systems are now routinely used in the 
eye care center by opthalmologists to image British Columbians daily. One of these systems is so high 
resolution that it can give picture of individuals rods and cones and gives images such as  shown in 
18_45_10-_47_PR_avgOctVol_dB.tif and 18_45_10-_47_PR_avgOctVol_dB.tif.  Each little dot of while is a 
single photoreceptor in the retina.

Professor Sarunic designs the retina imaging hardware; my students and I work on the algorithms to make 
measurements from these images using the tools of image processing such as those covered in this course. 
These measurements help opthalmologists quantify the state of anatomy of the retina and identify locations 
where a disease may be causing damage so it can be treated and the effect of treatment measured over time 
so treatment can be adjusted. Together, our two labs are a world-leading operation in the image acquisition 
and processing of three-dimensional retina OCT images with direct clinical applications.

The opthalmologists at Vancouver's Eye Care Center need a software tool that can count the number of 
these white dots (the photoreceptors - rods and cones) from these photoreceptor images and present a 
"quantity" map - an image that presents the number of photoreceptors in a local region (a mask whose 
size is user input say 3x3 and 5x5 etc). In some diseases, these photoreceptors are damaged and decrease 
in number so these "maps" can potentially show the clinician where the changes are and whether they are 
uniformly damaged or focally and selectively damaged.

Your project is design an algorithm (or algorithms) to count these photoreceptors and along with user 
supplied mask region size (say 3x3 or 5x5 or axb), generate a quantity map (number of receptors in a 
given roi centered at the pixel). You can start by taking a small region of the image (cropping off 
the rest) and working on that to develop your algorithm and then applying the working version to the 
full image. You are also asked to simulate a disease image in which some of these photoreceptors are 
randomly selected and destroyed in a localized region, mimicking the effect of a disease. Your algorithm 
should then show that your counting method is able to detect the changes in the quantity of these 
photoreceptors. Create a few different validation set of images, where there is one focal damage, or 
two locations of damage and some where there is uniform reduction in number etc and confirm whether 
your tool can find these regions and patterns of damage.

 

Note: You must not discuss your approach with your colleagues - this is truly your own final project 
and you are supposed to do it yourself entirely. There is no single correct approach - in fact, this 
is an open problem that has not been solved yet for the images such as this have only been available 
for a few short months and you are the first image processing class in the history of humanity to have 
a chance to solve an open and important problem that could make a difference in people's lives by 
improving vision care.

Your project will be graded on how creative your approach is, how accurate it is, and how much effort
 you show in developing the approach and tuning any parameters to work well on this set of images.
 Also, as before, your code needs to be extremely efficient, well-structured and well-documented and 
your report should identify approaches that worked AND those that didn't work, along with detailed 
discussion on what worked and what didn't. Only those projects that really show outstanding effort in 
all above categories will get an A or A+.

The last day of exams is April 21, 2017, so I am making your project due then. I believe the grades 
are due April 23rd so I will have a couple of days to grade the project. Those that want an extension
 can submit a one-page project report that states they are requesting an extension and for these 
uploaded requests, I will submit an incomplete grade. I can change the incomplete grade within the 
first two weeks of the next term when the project is finally submitted. As before, if there is no 
submission within the deadline, then it will be marked zero so if you are seeking an extension, you 
will need to submit a one-page document saying so. Those who are graduating after this term should 
not take the extension for obvious reason; an incomplete grade will show you have not completed the 
course which could interfere with your graduation.

 

Addendum: Note for graduate students who select this project as your final course project.

Not all images are perfect - there are distortions and some of these distortions are manifested as 
vertical streaks such as shown in figures OCTA+photoreceptor_artifacts.rarView in a new window. You 
can tell that these are distortions and not blood vessels since the blood vessels are devoid of any 
photoreceptors but the distortions aren't. If you are a grad student, and also working on this as your
 final project, then, in addition to above, you are tasked with developing an additional algorithmic 
layer that can identify the "distortion" band and reject measurements in this region before presenting 
the quantity map to the clinician.
