Non-rigid registration of images

Take your mugshot (template), and take another with a HUGE smile (target)...crop these images to be the 
same dimensions. Place corresponding landmarks on each image.

 

1) Using these landmarks, generate a non-rigid transformation that will transform your smile-free image 
towards the one with the smile, and vica versa.

Note 1 Choose a reasonable standard deviation for the Gaussian smoothing. If you choose something too 
small, it will create a very local movement of pixels. If you choose something too large, it will cause 
lots of pixels even from far away to move with the landmark. The proper sigma is dependent on the size 
of your image, and you can find one based on experimentation.

 
 Note 2 Plot the vector field u(x), the transformation varphileft(xright)=x+uleft(xright), and the inverse 
varphi^{^{-1}}left(xright)approx x-uleft(xright).
 

2) Place landmarks in the template so that the non-rigid transformation created from these will generate 
a motion that is physically not possible - ie say moving your eyes or nose in ways that humans can't do. 
 Assign the destination of each landmark in a way that you will anticipate will generate this motion. 
Transform your image in this way and show before and after transformation.
 

3) Create an 'animation' of the overall motion by taking small steps along the displacement and creating 
a transformation at each of these steps, apply to the image and save as an animated gif. Add some fun 
experiments that try different transformations of your mugshot image...maybe take a group photo and morph 
the faces in fun ways....Display an animated gif of this work.


Notes as before. Please do not share your codes with others though you are welcome to 'discuss' how the 
assignment is being done. You can use anyor all Matlab functions - however you must write your own codes.
