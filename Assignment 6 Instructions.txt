The company you are working for needs to tag images that are slowly varying from ones that are fast varying.

 

As the in-house image processing engineer, you are asked to design an algorithm to measure if an image is 
predominantly "low frequency" vs predominantly "high frequency". Ideally, your algorithm gives a score in 
the range of 0 - 100 for each image, where a score less than 50 is used to define an image as being 
predominantly "low" frequency and score greater than 50 is used to define an image as being predominantly 
"high" frequency image.

Task: design an appropriate algorithm for this task as required by your company...you can use any/all 
Matlab in-built commands you find useful.

Validation: To test your algorithm and show the results to your team, you decide to create a database 
of images with low and high frequency content. You take your mugshot image, and two or three more images 
you have taken yourself, and create 10-12 images from this initial set of 2-4 images. Half of these images 
contain predominantly low frequencies (ie you have taken out the high frequencies yourself) and the 
remaining of these images contain predominantly high frequencies (ie you have taken out the low frequencies 
yourself).

 

Next you generate a report in which you show these images and the score your frequency-metering algorithm 
creates for each image. Thanks to your work, your company is able to launch a frequency-metering app that 
becomes quite popular and earns the company several million dollars!

 

Deliverables: as before

1) identify all the parameters you have chosen, and give some intution on how your results depend on 
the choices you have made.

2) I am sorry I couldn't assign this week's assignment yesterday - so it is due next Saturday at 1 pm...
