Your employer is a local image-analysis company that creates products for satellite processing. 
The team wants a simple program that can find edges in images and use these edges for enhancement.

1) Implement an algorithm that uses a specified mask to find edges in your mugshot image - display the edges.

2) Enhance your mugshot image with an appropriate filter based on using edges in some way. 
Display the before and after images. Discuss the design of your filter you have chosen, and the effect of parameter choices, 
if any, on the results.

Notes:

1) Pay proper attention to display of images - if the appropriate scaling methods as discussed in class 
are not followed to display the images, the results will be incorrect. Choose appropriate boundary conditions.

2) Please follow the best practices for the submission/Matlab that have been identified in lecture 
and those the TA has sent via email.
